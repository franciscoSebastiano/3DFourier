mainheat.m is the main file that controls the program

runSim.m performs the fourier heat transfer solve on a given geometry

createGeom.m turns an input stl file into a set of cartesian coordinates for the simulation

plotStl.m plots a given geometry as an stl with a surface heat map based on the results of runSim.m

scatterPlotObject.m plots a fgiven geometry as a set of 3D coordinates color mapped based on heat results from runSim.m
